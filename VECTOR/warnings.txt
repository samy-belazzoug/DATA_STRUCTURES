THINGS I AM NOT IN CONTROL

IF USER MAKES A TYPE CONFUSION.
E.G : 
    vector_init(&v,1,3); --> CHAR
    int a = 8; --> INT
    vector_set_index(&v,1,&a);
    vector_get_index(&v,1,'d'); --> WILL PRINT 0

SIZE_T VALUES HAVE TO BE POSITIVE OR 0. NO  N E G A T I V E
In fact, item_size, capacity has to be positive (count is managed by myself so don't worry).

Truly personnal, thats for myself.
I AM STUPID.
So, in my set function, I used to loop through sizeof(vector->item_size), which is absolutely wrong.
In fact, I loop through the size of size_t (8 by default), not the size of vector->item_size (which actually depends on what the user wants).
That is pretty bad ngl.
